## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you understand and implement various AI algorithms through practical examples. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file or folder and is accompanied by documentation to explain how it works and how to run it.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- Some algorithms may require additional Python libraries (specified in their respective folders)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-practicals.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd ai-practicals
    ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install any required packages (if applicable):

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each algorithm is located in its own directory. To run an algorithm, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in its README or main file. For example:

1. Navigate to the water jug problem directory:

    ```sh
    cd water-jug-problem
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python water_jug.py
    ```

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Water Jug Problem**: Solves the classic water jug problem using various search strategies.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Implements the BFS algorithm for graph traversal.
- **Heuristic Search**: Demonstrates heuristic search techniques, including A* and greedy search.
- **Huffman Coding**: Implements Huffman's algorithm for lossless data compression.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Provides an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
